When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you're working on a project with a group you'll need a remote repository or if you
prefer working from different computers then you'll need a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your files/work can easily get overwritten that way. You may have made changes
that you want to push and if Git syncs that with your remote repo it might get
overwritten.
