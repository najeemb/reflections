When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you're working on a project with a group you'll need a remote repository or if you
prefer working from different computers then you'll need a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your files/work can easily get overwritten that way. You may have made changes
that you want to push and if Git syncs that with your remote repo it might get
overwritten.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

A fork copies a repo on GitHub to a new repo on GitHub. A clone allows you to copy
a remote repo to your local machine. A branch is a lineage of commits, i.e., commit
history. You would use a fork if you want to add/modify a repo on GitHub. You would
use a clone if you want to copy a remote repo to your local machine. You use a branch
inside a repo to track your master and create experimental copies of your codebase.
