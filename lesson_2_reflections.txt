What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initalize a repo Git begins tracking files as soon you make a 
commit. Initialization adds the metadata necessary to track files. You
need to initialize a repo so that Git sets it up properly for version
control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is where your files reside and thoee are the files
you edit. The staging area holds the files you are ready to commit. The
benefit is that you can remove or add files to the staging area before
you make the commit.
